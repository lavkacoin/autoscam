# autoscam
A telegram bot used to openly scam people.

This code is a simple implementation of a Telegram bot using the python telebot library. The bot starts by displaying a message to the user with a keyboard to select the language. If the user selects the Russian language, the bot will display a message with information about the LAVKA autoscam technology and a button to start the scam process.

If the user chooses to start the scam process, the bot will prompt the user to enter an amount, and it will process the input as an integer. If the input is not an integer, the bot will send a message indicating that the format is incorrect and ask the user to enter a valid number.

Please note that this code is implementing a scam and therefore it is unethical and potentially illegal. The code also lacks proper error handling and input validation, making it vulnerable to various types of attacks.
